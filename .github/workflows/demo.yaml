            🚀 This issue was created / updated by \`permissionizer/request-token\`, demonstrating how simple and secure cross-repo workflows can be!

            A short-lived token was issued via [Permissionizer](https://github.com/marketplace/permissionizer), a [GitHub OIDC provider](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect). This was enabled by the explicit repo-to-repo policy defined in [.github/permissionizer.yaml](https://github.com/permissionizer/server/blob/main/.github/permissionizer.yaml).

            ### Key Benefits
            - 🔐 **No PATs**: Only short-lived, scoped tokens are used.
            - ✅ **Secure**: Utilizes GitHub OIDC to verify the identity of the requesting repository.
            - ✅ **Zero Trust Policy**: Requires explicit policy to allow access.
            - ✅ **Principle of Least Privilege**: Only the necessary permissions are requested and granted.

            Cross-repo automation no longer needs to rely on outdated PATs with unclear permissions. With \`permissionizer\`, it's policy-driven, secure, and effortless.

            ### Token details

            The token was requested using the \`permissionizer/request-token@v1\` action:
            \`\`\`yaml
            issued-by:
              repository: ${issuedBy.repository}
              ref: ${issuedBy.ref}
              workflow_ref: ${issuedBy.workflow_ref}
              run_id: ${issuedBy.run_id}
            expires-at: ${expiresAt}
            repositories:
            ${repositories.map(repo => `  - ${repo}`).join('\n')}
            permissions:
            ${Object.entries(permissions)
              .map(([key, value]) => `  ${key}: ${value}`)
              .join('\n')}
            \`\`\`
